# Pro Pals

**Pro Pals** is a avatar app inspired by **[RoboFriends](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends)** from the ZTM Web Dev Course.  
Instead of robot avatars, Pro Pals features adorable characters from the IceBear dylan collection.  
It generates a list of random profiles using the **[DiceBear API](https://www.dicebear.com/)** and **[RandomUser API](https://randomuser.me/)**.
